# arduino-code-lock
An arduino code lock with an LCD display and other features

This project utilises a 4x4 num pad for entry, an LCD display, red and green LEDs and a buzzer which all runs off an Arduino Uno.

The password is stored in EEPROM and is changeable. When logged in it displays a scrollable menu to choose the different options. Passwords show as * when being entered
